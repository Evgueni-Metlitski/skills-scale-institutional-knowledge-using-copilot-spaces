# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (PM, PdM, Scrum Master, Developers, UX/UI Designer, BA, QA/Tester)
2. Requirements workshops facilitated by BA (if complex business requirements)
3. UX research findings review and design approach (UX/UI Designer, PdM)
4. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (PdM, BA, Scrum Master)
5. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points) with full team
6. Define Definition of Done (DoD) including testing and design criteria
7. Identify dependencies and integration points
8. Create release plan and milestone map (PM, PdM, Scrum Master)
9. Establish test strategy and automation approach (QA/Tester, Developers)

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Facilitated by Scrum Master with input from PdM and team
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure design assets are ready (UX/UI Designer confirms)
- Confirm test approach for each item (QA/Tester input)
- Ensure team capacity is respected
- BA available to clarify requirements during planning

## Risk & Dependency Management
